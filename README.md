This project aims to develop a mini desktop search engine capable of searching through a collection of HTML documents. The search engine identifies specified keywords, ignoring predefined stop words, HTML tags, and punctuations, and returns a list of documents where these keywords are found. Each word's frequency in the documents is tracked using a binary search tree to optimize search efficiency.
